        <p>
            i am a child, particularly a <i>school student</i> at my school.Today you'll get to learn alot about by school.</p>
        
        <p>
            If you wonder which <i>specific</i> school i study at. That school is called <b>Mastermind English Medium School</b> or <b>MEMS</b> i'll like to call.

            According to the official MEMS webisite(link here:
            <a href=https://www.mastermindschool.org/>Mastermindschool.org</a>)it states that <i>"MEMS has been committed to global learning long before it became an indispensable feature of contemporary education.
            Established in 1997, we proudly stand as the 1st English medium school in Bangladesh to adopt both Pearson Edexcel and
            Cambridge curriculum (in O and A levels),",</i>it is proudly stated in their website that they are one of the first school to adopt both <i>Pearson Edexel</i> and <i>Cambridge curriculum</i>. As you can see i study at an <i>extraordinary</i> school. I personally love my school, made many friends there, partook in many dramas, events etc. I laughed with my people around me, Taught lessons i later forgetten, and many more. It is a <i>school</i>, it has all the school stuff you'd expect. Its not and <i>extraordinary school</i> but i like it the way it is already, no need to be <i>that</i> perfect in the art teaching as i think it would ruin the many joys it has.

            Know that you know what my school is all about, its a right thing to show about what my school looks like and all that.
